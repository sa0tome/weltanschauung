# Hello, world!  

This is a place where I register a little bit about me. There's no order, and I achieve to be less organized as possible. Site is minimal because I'm not a fan of CSS and I want to focus on writing and producing art. Some posts I'll write in English, others will be in another language. Currently, I know:  
- Portuguese (Native)
- English (Fluent)
- Spanish (I can keep up a conversation and I'm capable of reading/writing, but with support)
- Japanese (I can talk with my family and I would probably survive even without translator in Japan, but I barely can read kanjis)  

Anyway, I like learning new languages, also new cultures. I think I'm a deep humanist.

### You know, the journey of creating personal blogs...
That's not my first time that I've created a personal blog. Thinking back, all the attempts were failed because I was trying to achieve perfection. Now, this is not my intention. I discovered that I have a bunch of things to store and share, so I just want to be practical.  
Today, I'll deliver less code and more content.
